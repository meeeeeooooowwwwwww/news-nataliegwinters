Is this the part of css that is responsible for the logo etc I drew a red border around and showed you? /* Header */

Yes, the CSS block you provided (/* Header */) is indeed responsible for the layout and styling of the section you outlined with a red border in the screenshot, which includes the "Natalie Winters News" logo and the tagline "Breaking News & Investigative Reporting." This section is part of the <header id="header"> element on your homepage. Let’s break down how this CSS affects its positioning and why it might appear "too high" on large screens, then suggest adjustments.
Analysis of the CSS
Key Properties of #header
css

#header {
    position: relative;
    background-image: url("../../images/header.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    color: #ffe7fb;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 7.5em 0 2em 0; /* Top padding: 7.5em, bottom padding: 2em */
    cursor: default;
}

Position: position: relative means the header is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. This allows its children (e.g., .inner, h1, p) to be positioned relative to it.

Padding: padding: 7.5em 0 2em 0 adds 7.5em of space at the top and 2em at the bottom. This padding should push the content (logo and tagline) down from the top edge of the viewport, but the total height and surrounding elements might affect the perceived "too high" issue.

Background: The fixed background image and full coverage (background-size: cover) suggest the header spans the full viewport width, which aligns with the screenshot’s wide layout.

Child Elements
#header .inner: Contains the content, positioned relative with vertical-align: middle.

#header h1: Styles the "Natalie Winters News" logo with font-size: 3em (or 4em on the homepage).

#header header > p: Styles the tagline with font-size: 1.25em.

Homepage-Specific Styles
css

body.homepage #header {
    height: 100vh;
    min-height: 40em;
}

body.homepage #header h1 {
    font-size: 4em;
}

Height: height: 100vh sets the header to the full viewport height on the homepage, and min-height: 40em ensures it’s at least 40em tall. This could cause the content to be vertically centered within a tall container, potentially making it appear high if the surrounding content isn’t adjusted.

Font Size: font-size: 4em on the homepage makes the logo larger, which might amplify the perception of it being too close to the top.

Preload Effect
css

body.homepage.is-preload #header:after {
    opacity: 1;
}

This adds a semi-transparent overlay (#fca5e9) that fades in, but it doesn’t affect positioning directly.

Why It Appears "Too High" on Large Screens
Viewport Height: height: 100vh on body.homepage #header forces the header to fill the entire viewport height. With text-align: center and vertical-align: middle (via the :before pseudo-element), the logo and tagline are vertically centered within this tall container. On large screens, this centering might place them near the top if there’s no additional top padding or offset to push them down further.

Lack of Top Margin: The padding: 7.5em 0 2em 0 provides top padding, but it’s applied inside the header. If the header itself is flush with the top of the viewport (no external margin or offset), the content might still feel too high, especially with a tall 100vh container.

Navigation Bar: The navigation bar above the header (visible in the screenshot) might be overlapping or positioned absolutely/fixed, reducing the perceived space above the logo.

Verification with Screenshot
The red-outlined section includes the logo and tagline, which are inside <header id="header">.

The navigation bar ("Home", "War Room Articles", etc.) is likely in a separate element (e.g., #nav or a fixed header), but the CSS you provided doesn’t cover it. This suggests the issue might also involve the navigation bar’s positioning pushing content down, making the logo appear too high relative to the page content.

Suggested Fix
To lower the logo and tagline on large screens, we need to add a top margin or padding to the header or adjust its vertical alignment. Since height: 100vh is intentional for a full-screen effect, let’s tweak the internal positioning.
Option 1: Add Top Padding to #header
Increase the top padding to push the content down:
css

body.homepage #header {
    height: 100vh;
    min-height: 40em;
    padding-top: 10em; /* Increase from 7.5em to 10em or more */
    padding-bottom: 2em;
}

Effect: Moves the vertically centered content lower within the viewport.

Test: Adjust 10em to 12em or 15em to see what looks best on large screens.

Option 2: Add Margin to #header
Add an external margin to offset the header from the top:
css

body.homepage #header {
    height: 100vh;
    min-height: 40em;
    margin-top: 2em; /* Add margin above the header */
    padding: 7.5em 0 2em 0;
}

Effect: Shifts the entire header down, preserving internal padding.

Note: Ensure this doesn’t conflict with the navigation bar (see below).

Option 3: Adjust Navigation Bar Positioning
If the navigation bar is fixed or absolute, it might be overlapping. Check for a #nav or similar in main.css (not in your snippet):
css

#nav {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    /* Add bottom margin or padding to create space */
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}

If #nav exists, ensure it doesn’t overlap #header by adding a top margin to #header or a bottom margin to #nav.

Recommended Change
Let’s try Option 1 with increased padding, as it’s the simplest and keeps the full-screen effect:
css

/* Header */
#header {
    position: relative;
    background-image: url("../../images/header.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    color: #ffe7fb;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10em 0 2em 0; /* Increased top padding from 7.5em to 10em */
    cursor: default;
}

/* Homepage-specific */
body.homepage #header {
    height: 100vh;
    min-height: 40em;
}

Why: The extra 2.5em of padding should lower the centered content enough to create breathing room on large screens, while the 100vh height remains intact.

Step 4: Deploy and Test
Update assets/css/main.css:
Replace the #header and body.homepage #header sections with the updated CSS above.

Commit and Push:
bash

git add assets/css/main.css
git commit -m "Increase header padding to lower logo on large screens"
git push origin main

Test:
Visit https://news.nataliegwinters.com/ on a large screen.

Check if the "Natalie Winters News" logo and tagline are lower (e.g., 2-3em below the top edge).

Resize to a small screen (below 736px) to ensure it still looks good.

If It’s Still Too High
Check Navigation Bar: Share the #nav CSS from main.css if it exists, and we’ll adjust its positioning.

Inspect Element: Use browser dev tools (F12 > Elements) to see if another element (e.g., a fixed nav) is affecting the layout.

Increase Padding: Bump padding-top to 12em or 15em if needed.

This should resolve the positioning issue! Let me know the result or share more CSS if the nav bar is involved.
